This is the code for the microcontroller that is in my pimped out gaggia baby. It controls the pump, sosame lenoid valve and boiler in an attempt to make my morning brews easier(its actually only complicated things) 

TODO:
1. Steam - add settings for boiler temp in steam mode
2. Hot water - same temp as steam. Put in pressure failsafe with reminder to open steam valve. dispense by volume.
3. WiFi - initially to keep the clock synced with NTP Server, then expand to home assistant integration (probably mqtt)
4. OTA updates - so that i dont have to dissasemble to upload code.
5. Lots more
